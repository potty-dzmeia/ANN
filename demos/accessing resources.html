     <h1>Accessing Resources in a Location-Independent Manner</h1>
</center>

<p> Code written for the Java 1.0 platform
uses two mechanisms to access resources.  
</p><ul>
    <li>Applets use <em>Applet.getCodeBase()</em> to get a
    URL to the base of the code for the applet.  This base can be
    extended with a "relative path" to point to the desired resource, which
    can then be loaded (for example using
    <em>Applet.getAudioClip(url)</em>).
    </li><li>Applications use "well known locations" (such as
    <em>System.getProperty("user.home")</em> or
    <em>System.getProperty("java.home"))</em>.  They add
    "/lib/&lt;resource&gt;" to the location and then open that file.
</li></ul>

<p> The Java 1.0 platform lacks  a mechanism to locate resources that are
independent of the code.  That is, there is no way locate resources for an applet loaded from the net using
multiple http connects, or for an applet loaded using JAR files, or for a Bean
loaded or a Bean installed in the CLASSPATH, or for a "library" installed in
the CLASSPATH, and so on.  The APIs described here provide such a mechanism.

</p><p> The I18N APIs use this API as a primitive operation to locate
<em>ResourceBundle</em>s.  See the latest I18N documentation for details.

</p><h2>Resources, names, and contexts</h2>

<p>A resource is identified by a String.  This String, while possibly empty, is a <b>/</b>-separated sequence of substrings, each a valid Java
programming lanaugage identifier, followed by a name of the form "&lt;shortName&gt;" or
"&lt;shortName&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;".  Both "shortName" and
"extension" are composed of valid Java Letters and Numbers (section
3.8 in JLS).  If the optional sequence exists, it is separated from
the "shortName" by a <b>/</b>.

</p><p>The name of a resource is independent of the Java implementation;
in particular, the <b>/</b> is always used as a separator.
However, the Java implementation controls the details of how the
contents of the resource are mapped into a file, database, or other
object containing the actual resource.

</p><p>The interpretation of a resource name is relative to a ClassLoader
instance.  Methods implemented by the ClassLoader do this interpretation.

</p><h2>System Resources</h2>

<p>A system resource is similar to a system class (section 20.14.5 of
the JLS). A system resource is a resource that is either built-in to
the system, or it is kept by the host implementation in, for example, a
local
file system. System resources are accessed through special
methods (<em>getSystemResource</em> and
<em>getSystemResourceAsStream</em>) that consult the base
host implementation.

</p><p>For example, in a particular implementation, locating a system
resource may involve searching the entries in the CLASSPATH. Each
directory, zip file, or jar file entry in the CLASSPATH is searched for
the resource file, and, if found, either an InputStream, or its name,
is returned.
If not found, null is returned. Note that a resource may be found in
a different entry in the CLASSPATH than where the class file was
loaded.
</p><h2>Non-System Resources</h2>

The implementation of <em>getResource</em> on a given <em>ClassLoader</em>
will depend on the details of the ClassLoader.  For example AppletClassLoader
will:

<ul>
<li>First try to locate the resource as a system resource; then, if not found,

</li><li>Search through the resources in ARCHIVES (JAR files) already
loaded in this CODEBASE; then, if not found,

</li><li>Use CODEBASE and attempt to locate the resource (which may involve
contacting a remote site).
</li></ul>

<p> All ClassLoaders will search for a resource first as a system 
resource, in a manner analogous to searcing for class files.  This 
search rule permits overwriting locally any resource.  Clients should 
choose a resource name that will be unique (using the company or package 
name as a prefix, for instance).

</p><h2>Resource Names</h2>

<p> A common convention for the name of a resource used by a class is
to use the fully qualified name of the package of the class, convert
all "." to "/", and add a resource name of the form "&lt;Name&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;".
To support this, and to simplify handling the details of system
classes (for which <em>getClassLoader</em> returns <b>null</b>),
the class Class provides two convenience methods that call the
appropriate methods in <em>ClassLoader</em>.

</p><p> The resource name given to a Class method may have an initial
starting "/" that identifies it as an "absolute" name.
Resource names that do not start with a "/" are "relative".

</p><p>Absolute names are stripped of their starting "/" and are passed,
without any further modification, to the appropriate ClassLoader
method to locate the resource.
Relative names are modified according to the convention described
previously and then are passed to a ClassLoader method.

</p><h2>Manipulating Resources</h2>

<p> The method <em>getResource()</em> returns a URL for the resource.
The URL (and its representation) is implementation and JVM<b>*</b>-instance 
specific (the URL obtained in one runtime instance may not work in 
another) and may vary depending on the implementation details 
Its protocol is (usually) specific to the ClassLoader loading the resource.
If the resource does not exist, a null will be returned; if the resource 
is not visible due to security considerations, a null will also be 
returned.

</p><p> If the client code wants to read the contents of the resource
as an InputStream, it can apply the <em>openStream()</em> method on
the url.  This is common enough to justify adding
<em>getResourceAsStream()</em> to Class and ClassLoader. 
<em>getResourceAsStream()</em> is semantically identical to 
<em>getResource().openStream()</em>, except that IO exceptions are 
caught and returned as a null <em>InputStream</em>.

</p><p> The client code code can also request the contents of the
resource as an object by applying the <em>getContent()</em> method
on the url.  This is useful when the resource contains the data
for an image, for instance. Note that in this case, the result is 
an <em>awt.image.ImageProducer</em> object, not an <em>Image</em> object.

</p><h2>API Additions to Class</h2>

<p>Specifically, the class <em>Class</em> methods are of the following
form:

</p><pre><code>
class Class {

    /**
     * Find a resource with a given name.  Will return null if no
     * resource with this name is found.  The rules for searching a
     * resources associated with a given class are implemented by the
     * ClassLoader of the class.
     *
     * The Class methods delegate to ClassLoader methods, after applying
     * a naming convention: if the resource name starts with "/", it is used
     * as is.  Otherwise, the name of the package is prepended, after
     * converting "." to "/".
     *
     * @see java.lang.ClassLoader
     */
    public InputStream getResourceAsStream(String name) {
	name = resolveName(name);
	ClassLoader cl = getClassLoader();
	if (cl==null) {
	    // A system class.
	    return ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream(name);
	}
	return cl.getResourceAsStream(name);
    }

    public java.net.URL getResource(String name) {
	name = resolveName(name);
	ClassLoader cl = getClassLoader();
	if (cl==null) {
	    // A system class.
	    return ClassLoader.getSystemResource(name);
	}
	return cl.getResource(name);
    }

    /**
     * Add a package name prefix if the name is not absolute
     * Remove leading "/" if name is absolute
     */
    private String resolveName(String name) {
	if (name == null) {
	    return name;
	}
	if (!name.startsWith("/")) {
	    Class c = this;
	    while (c.isArray()) {
		c = c.getComponentType();
	    }
	    String baseName = c.getName();
	    int index = baseName.lastIndexOf('.');
	    if (index != -1) {
		name = baseName.substring(0, index).replace('.', '/')
		    +"/"+name;
	    }
	} else {
	    name = name.substring(1);
	}
	return name;
    }


</code>
</pre>

<p> Note that it is possible, albeit somewhat uncommon, to have two
classes in two diffent packages sharing the same resource.

</p><h2>API Additions to ClassLoader</h2>

<p> We provide two sets of methods to access a resource. One set returns
an InputStream on the resource.  The other set returns a URL. 
The methods that return an 
InputStream are somewhat easier to use and will
satisfy many needs, while the methods that return URLs provide
access to more complex information, such as an Image and an AudioClip.

</p><p>Resources are managed through ClassLoaders in a manner analogous
to classes.  A ClassLoader controls how to map the name of
a resource to its content.  ClassLoader also provides methods for
accessing <em>system resources</em>, analogous to the <em>system
classes</em>.
Class Class provides some convenience methods that delegate functionality
to the appropriate ClassLoader methods.

</p><p>Many Java programs will access these methods indirectly through the
I18N APIs.  Others will access it through methods in class Class.
A few will directly invoke the ClassLoader methods.

</p><p>The methods in ClassLoader use the given String as the name of the
resource without applying any absolute/relative transformation
(cf. the methods in Class).
The name should not have a leading "/".

</p><pre><code>
class ClassLoader {

    /**
     * A resource is some data (images, audio, text, etc) that wants to be
     * accessed by some class code in a way that is independent of the
     * location of the code.  Resources are found with cooperation of the
     * class loaders, since they are the only ones who know where the class
     * actually came from. </code><p>
     *
     * System resources are those that are handled by the host implemenation
     * directly.  For example, they may be located in the CLASSPATH.</p><p>
     *
     * The name of a resource is a "/"-separated sequence of identifiers.
     * The class Class provides convenience methods for accessing resources;
     * the methods implement a convention where the package name is prefixed
     * to the short name of the resource.</p><p>
     * 
     * Resources can be accessed as an InputStream, or as a URL.
     *
     * @see	Class
     */

    /**
     * Get an InputStream on a given resource..  Will return null if no
     * resource with this name is found. </p><p>
     *
     * The resource name may be any system resource (e.g. follows CLASSPATH order)
     * @param	name	the name of the resource, to be used as is.
     * @return		an InputStream on the resource, or null if not found.
     */

    public static final InputStream getSystemResourceAsStream(String name) {
	... this is equivalent to getSystemResource() call plus a openStream()
    }

    /**
     * Find a resource with a given name.  The return is a URL to the resource
     * Doing a getContent() on the URL may return an ImageProducer, an AudioClip, or
     * an InputStream.</p><p>
     *
     * The resource name may be any system resource (e.g. follows CLASSPATH order)
     * @param	name	the name of the resource, to be used as is.
     * @return		the URL on the resource, or null if not found.
     */
    public static final java.net.URL getSystemResource(String name) {
	...
    }

    /**
     */

    /**
     * Get an InputStream on a given resource.  Will return null if no
     * resource with this name is found. </p><p>
     *
     * The class loader can choose what to do to locate the resource.
     * @param	name	the name of the resource, to be used as is.
     * @return		an InputStream on the resource, or null if not found.
     */
    public InputStream getResourceAsStream(String name) {
	return null;
    }

    /**
     * Find a resource with a given name.  The return is a URL to the resource.
     * Doing a getContent() on the URL may return an ImageProducer, an AudioClip,
     * or an InputStream.</p><p>
     *
     * The class loader can choose what to do to locate the resource.
     * @param	name	the name of the resource, to be used as is.
     * @return		an InputStream on the resource, or null if not found.
     */
    public java.net.URL getResource(String name) {
	return null;
    }

    }

</p></pre>

<h2>Client code</h2>

<p>Below are two examples of client code.  The first example uses "absolute
resource" names and traditional mechanisms to get a class Class
object:

</p><pre><code>
package pkg;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;

class Test {

    private static final String absName = "/pkg/mumble.baf";

    public static void test1() {
	Class c=null;
	try {
	    c = Class.forName("pkg.Test");
	} catch (Exception ex) {
	    // This should not happen.
	}
	InputStream s = c.getResourceAsStream(absName);
	// do something with it.
    }

    public void test2() {
	InputStream s = this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(absName);
	// do something with it.
    }

</code>
</pre>

<p>The second example uses "relative resource" names and the new
mechanism, available from the compiler through the -experimental flag,
to get a class Class object:

</p><pre><code>
package pkg;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;

class Test {

    private static final String relName = "mumble.baf";

    public static void test1() {
	InputStream s = Test.class.getResourceAsStream(relName);
	// do something with it.
    }

    public void test2() {
	InputStream s = Test.class.getResourceAsStream(relName);
	// do something with it.
    }

</code>
</pre>

<h2>Security Details</h2>

Since <em>getResource()</em> provides access to information, it must have well
defined and well founded security rules that at the same time support
the intended use of this mechanism.  Below we describe the exact
details, as specified and implemented in releases starting at version 
1.1.5 of the Java Development Kit.  The semantics are described only for 
<em>ClassLoader.getResource</em> 
and <em>ClassLoader.getSystemResource()</em> and extend to the 
<em>AsStream</em> methods as defined in the previous section.
<p>
If security considerations do not allow a resource to be visible in
some security context, the <em>getResource()</em> method will fail (will 
return null) as if the resource was not present at all, this addresses
existence attacks.
</p><p>
All classloaders will not provide access to the contents of a
.class file.  This is for both security and performance issues.
Whether it is possible to obtain a URL into a .class file depends
on the specifics, as shown below.
</p><p>
There are no specified security issues or restrictions regarding
resources that are found by a non-system class loader.
<em>AppletClassLoader</em> provides access to information that is loaded from
some source location, either individually, or in a group through a JAR
file; thus <em>AppletClassLoader</em> should apply the same 
<em>checkConnect()</em> rules when dealing with URLs through 
<em>getResource()</em>.
</p><p>
The system Class Loader provides access to information in the
CLASSPATH.  A CLASSPATH may have directories and/or JAR files.  Since
a JAR file is created intentionally, we ascribe a different
significance to it than in a directory where things may end up in a
more casual manner.  In particular, we are more strict on getting
information out of a directory than out from a JAR file.
</p><p>
If the resource is in a Directory:
  </p><ul>
   <li><em>getResource()</em> invocations will use 
    <em>File.exists()</em> to determine whether
    to make the corresponding file visible to the user.  Recall that 
    <em>File.exists()</em> uses the 
    <em>checkRead()</em> method in the security manager.

   </li><li>the same applies to <em>getResourceAsStream()</em>.
  </li></ul>
<p>
If the resource is in a JAR file:
  </p><ul>
   <li><em>getResource()</em> invocations will succeed for all files, 
    regardless of whether the invocation is done from within a System or 
    a non-System class.

   </li><li><em>getResourceAsStream()</em> invocations will succeed for non 
     .class resources, and so will for <em>getContent()</em> on corresponding 
     URLs.
  </li></ul>
